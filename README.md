## Rithmomachy

A late-medieval mathematical board game, known as 'The Philosopher's
Game'.

Here's [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rithmomachy) on the subject,
and [here's](http://www.gamecabinet.com/rules/Rithmomachia.html) a more 
thorough look at the rules.

## Development progress:
Currently, this implementation includes Rounds, Triangles, Squares and
Pyramids. They can all move according to (a set of) the rules, but no captures
are implemented and certainly no victories. 

I'm actively researching the backend and interface options while I finish the
game logic.

## Dependencies:
The app runs on ES6, whenever possible. I.e., I have been using as much
ECMAScript6 as Node.js 5 allows. I'm using eslint with airbnb's config.
