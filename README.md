## Rithmomachy

A late-medieval mathematical board game. In fact, this is 'The Philosopher's
Game' (a monicker I'm sure many of my chess player philosophy major friends 
might strongly object to).

Here's [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rithmomachy) on the subject,
and [here's](http://jducoeur.org/game-hist/game-recon-rhyth1.html) a more 
thorough look at the rules.

## Development progress:
Currently, this implementation includes Rounds, Triangles and Squares, but not
pyramids. 

The pieces can move according to the rules, and they are displayed 
(crudely) on an html table drawn in index.html.

I have begun writing tests, using mocha, since it has already become tedious to
manually test new features or functions.
